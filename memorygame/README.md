##Description

A tile flipping game, built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Instructions
Flip to match pairs of tiles with like partners. Match all the cards to win! Choosing the wrong cards enough times will cause you to lose stars, eventually going from three to zero. There is also a timer counting down so time is of the essence.
