## Description

A classic arcade game styled similar to frogger. The game involves moving up the screen while dodging bugs of varying speeds and placements. Uses object oriented programming to define classes and keyboard input for movement.

## Instructions


Use your keyboards arrow keys to move upwards across the screen while dodging the bugs. Try to catch the gem if you are able to as it will slow the bugs down. Reaching the water ends the game. Getting hit by a bug will send you back to the start though!
